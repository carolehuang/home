	<p>Growing up in crazy, diverse, and foggy San Francisco, CA, my environment has shaped to be the best version of myself as can be.</p>
	<p>I love to surround myself with live music, cold brewed coffee, and the smell of fresh air.</p>
	<p>Advocate for women empowerment, environmental lover, and promotes ethical shopping.
